    "reasoning": "This Firestore structure prioritizes security, scalability, and debuggability, focusing on Authorization Independence. The primary strategy is to use path-based ownership for user data. Since the request only mentions User entity and basic auth functionality, the structure is straightforward. This eliminates the need for complex security rules involving `get()` calls, ensuring atomic operations and easier debugging.  QAPs are supported by the inherent security of path-based ownership.\n\nThe `/users/{userId}` collection stores user profiles. Security rules will ensure that only the authenticated user (whose `uid` matches `userId`) can read and write their own profile data. No denormalization is needed at this level because the User entity doesn't have a parent entity whose attributes it needs to inherit."
